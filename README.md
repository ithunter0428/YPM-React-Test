Task 1: Build a simple React application that allows users to create, read, update and delete notes.
Requirements:
The user should be able to create a new note by filling out a form that includes a title and body.
The user should be able to view all existing notes in a list format, displaying the title and a preview of the body.
The user should be able to click on a note in the list to view its full content.
The user should be able to edit the title and body of an existing note.
The user should be able to delete a note.
The application should be styled using CSS, with a clean and simple design.
The application should be responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices.
The application should use React for building the user interface.
Bonus:
Implement search functionality to allow the user to search for specific notes based on their title or body content.
Implement sorting functionality to allow the user to sort notes by title, date created or date modified.
Please submit your code via GitHub or a similar code-sharing platform, along with instructions for running the application.
Task 2: Find and fix issues with the following code:

function multiplyByClosure(mult) {
  const values = [0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'a', false];
  return values.map(function(value) { 
	if(typeof value === 'number') {
		return value * mult
	}
	return value;
  });
}

function countZeroValues(values) {
	return values.filter(function(value) {
		return value == 0
	}).length
}

const multiplyByTwo = multiplyByClosure(2);
console.log(multiplyByTwo);

const multiplyByThree = multiplyByClosure(3);
console.log(multiplyByThree);

// count zero values, expecting 1:
console.log(countZeroValues(multiplyByTwo));

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	
	const button = document.createElement('button');
	button.textContent = `Multiply by ${i}`;
	document.body.appendChild(button);

    button.onclick = function() {
        console.log(multiplyByClosure(i))
    };
}
